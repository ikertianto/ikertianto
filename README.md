I'm a System Analyst passionate about building efficient digital solutions that solve real-world problems. Currently focused on enhancing systems with better architecture, automation, and user experience.

## 👀 I’m interested in:

- Infrastructure & Logging (ELK Stack, Apache APISIX, Keycloak)
- Exploring open-source tools like Liquibase, Apache Camel, and more
- Building intelligent systems using algorithms (like Genetic Algorithms for scheduling)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced system integration using Apache Camel
- Infrastructure automation & observability
- Rich Text Editor customization with Plate.js
- Mobile app development (reviving an old scheduling app project!)

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
